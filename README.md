# NyTermsHub

A first order theorem prover with equality.

To build and run the this application, 
the command line tool, or the unit tests 
the following data and libraries have to be installed.

- flex, yacc (preinstalled)
- TPTP problem files
- yices  2
- z3

##Flex and Yacc
====

â€¦ are preinstalled on Macs. See `Docs/yacc` in this project for configuration details.

##TPTP problem files
====

Download the current release of the TPTP 
(*Thousands of Problems for Theorem Provers*) Library from [www.cs.miami.edu/~tptp/](http://www.cs.miami.edu/~tptp/) 
that contains problems, axiom sets, documents, and utilities. 
Unpack the archive, 
move the resulting directory to any place you like, 
and create a symbolic link `TPTP` to the directory in `/Users/Shared/`.
(Or you edit the xcode scheme to set -tptp_root or TPTP_ROOT 
to the path where directories 'Axioms' and 'Problems' are residing)

    cd /Users/Shared/
    tar -xzf ~/Downloads/TPTP-v6.3.0.tgz 
    tar -xz ~/Downloads/TPTP-v6.3.0.tar
    ln -s TPTP-v6.3.0 TPTP

The tptp root path default is `/Users/Shared/TPTP`.

For `TptpPathTests` to succeed copy these files:


cp /Users/Shared/TPTP/Problems/SYN/SYN000-2.p /Users/Shared/SampleA.p
cp /Users/Shared/TPTP/Axioms/SYN000-0.ax /Users/Shared/AxiomB.ax
mkdir /Users/Shared/Axioms
cp /Users/Shared/TPTP/Axioms/SYN000-0.ax /Users/Shared/Axioms/AxiomsC.ax

## Yices 2, Z3 (SMT Prover)
=====

Download and install yices 2 for Mac OS X (64 bits) from [yices.csl.sri.com](http://yices.csl.sri.com). This project uses the precompiled binary.
Follow the instructions from the website. Check for the following files on your system:

    /usr/local/include/yices.h
    /usr/local/lib/libz3.dylib

Download, build and install z3 (by Microsoft) from [Github](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3). This project uses the build from source version.
Follow the instructions from the website. Check for the following files on your system:

    /usr/local/include/z3.h
    /usr/local/lib/libyices.dylib

### project linker flags

    -lyices -lz3 -L/usr/local/lib

See also `Docs/Yices` and `Docs/z3` in this project for configuration details.
