To build and run the the app, the command line tool, or the unit tests some data and libraries have to be installed.

Flex and Yacc
====

â€¦ are preinstalled on Macs. See `Docs/yacc` in this project for configuration details.

TPTP
====

Download the current release of the TPTP 
(*Thousands of Problems for Theorem Provers*) Library from [www.cs.miami.edu/~tptp/](http://www.cs.miami.edu/~tptp/) 
that contains problems, axiom sets, documents, and utilities. 
Unpack the archive, 
move the resulting directory to any place you like, 
and create a symbolic link `TPTP` to the directory in `/Users/Shared/`.
(Or you edit the xcode scheme to set -tptp_root or TPTP_ROOT 
to the path where directories 'Axioms' and 'Problems' are residing)


    
    cd /Users/Shared/
    tar -xzf ~/Downloads/TPTP-v6.3.0.tgz 
    tar -xz ~/Downloads/TPTP-v6.3.0.tar
    ln -s TPTP-v6.3.0 TPTP

The tptp root path default is `/Users/Shared/TPTP`.

For `TptpPathTests` to succeed copy these files:


    cp /Users/Shared/TPTP/Problems/SYN/SYN000-2.p /Users/Shared/SampleA.p
    cp /Users/Shared/TPTP/Axioms/SYN000-0.ax /Users/Shared/AxiomB.ax
    mkdir /Users/Shared/Axioms
    cp /Users/Shared/TPTP/Axioms/SYN000-0.ax /Users/Shared/Axioms/AxiomsC.ax
